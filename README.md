# Azure-Inventory-CLI-Tool
Azure Resource Inventory CLI Tool: Lists Azure resources across subscriptions

To initialize go.mod and go.sum for your Go project, follow these steps in your project directory:

Open a terminal and navigate to your project folder:

Initialize the Go module (replace azure-inventory-cli-tool with your desired module name, usually your repo path):

Add dependencies (this will also create/update go.sum):

Now, go.mod and go.sum will be created and managed automatically.

Summary:

go.mod tracks your module and its requirements.
go.sum ensures dependency integrity.
Use go mod tidy anytime to clean up unused dependencies.
